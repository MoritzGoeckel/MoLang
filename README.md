# Molang
This is an fully home made interpreter for an c like language. I build this solely for educational purpose, so maybe you should not use this in production :)

## Example code
```
a = 10 * 30 + 1;
b = a / 3;
```

## Features
- [x] Simple operators (+-*/%)
- [x] Assignment (=)
- [x] Variables
- [x] Number literals (1, 2, 3 etc.)
- [x] Multiline programs (seperated by ';')

## Tests
The entire project is unit tested with a current line coverage of 92%.
